One one or more farmers break the convention the common land becomes over used, the grass dies, and it is no longer useful to anyone in the village.</p> <p>In graph systems thinking (GST) we think of commons as a central area that each business unit puts shared information about shared customers.

Make the default text size be 16. Create a five layer stair step diagram of a capability-maturity model. The first layer is at the bottom and covers the width of the canvas. The top layer in smaller at the top right. As the user hovers the mouse over each layer, a detailed text description of that layer will appear below the steps. The rectangle colors will be L1: red, L2: orange, L3: yellow, L4: green, L5: blue. The text color in the L2: orange and L3: yellow will be black. The text in the red, green and blue will be white. Use the following text for the level definitions and descriptions:</p> <p>Level 1 - Initial Initial is characteristic of processes at this level that they are (typically) undocumented and in a state of dynamic change, tending to be driven in an ad hoc, uncontrolled and reactive manner by users or events. This provides a chaotic or unstable environment for the processes. (Example - a surgeon performing a new operation a small number of times - the levels of negative outcome are not known). Level 2 - Repeatable Repeatable is characteristic of this level of maturity that some processes are repeatable, possibly with consistent results. Process discipline is unlikely to be rigorous, but where it exists it may help to ensure that existing processes are maintained during times of stress. Level 3 - Defined Defined is characteristic of processes at this level that there are sets of defined and documented standard processes established and subject to some degree of improvement over time. These standard processes are in place. The processes may not have been systematically or repeatedly used - sufficient for the users to become competent or the process to be validated in a range of situations. This could be considered a developmental stage - with use in a wider range of conditions and user competence development the process can develop to next level of maturity. Level 4 - Managed (Capable) Managed is characteristic of processes at this level that, using process metrics, effective achievement of the process objectives can be evidenced across a range of operational conditions. The suitability of the process in multiple environments has been tested and the process refined and adapted. Process users have experienced the process in multiple and varied conditions, and are able to demonstrate competence. The process maturity enables adaptions to particular projects without measurable losses of quality or deviations from specifications. Process Capability is established from this level. (Example - surgeon performing an operation hundreds of times with levels of negative outcome approaching zero). Level 5 - Optimizing (Efficient) It is a characteristic of processes at this level that the focus is on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological changes/improvements. At maturity level 5, processes are concerned with addressing statistical common causes of process variation and changing the process (for example, to shift the mean of the process performance) to improve process performance. This would be done at the same time as maintaining the likelihood of achieving the established quantitative process-improvement objectives.</p> <p>```</p>"},{"location":"colophon/","title":"Colophon","text":"<p>A brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as how the ideas were generated, how the text was stored and how the content was transmitted to the publisher.</p> <p>We used GPT-3 to generate outlines and provide concept definitions.

Each farmer has their own private land.  However, there is a large shared pasture in the middle of the village.</p> <p></p> <p>Individual farmers, who have open access to a shared pasture, act independently according to their self-interest and, contrary to the common good of all farmers, cause overgrazing of the shared pasture.  This overgrazing makes the pasture have no value to the entire community.</p> <p>This archetype can be represented with two simple loops, one for adding cows and one for removing cows.</p>"},{"location":"archetypes/commons/#causal-loop-diagram","title":"Causal Loop Diagram","text":"<p>Here is a sample causal loop diagram.

This process results in novel outcomes that are more than the sum of the system's parts, often observed in complex adaptive systems across various fields.</p> <p>Throughout my career, I have seen databases grow from tens of thousands of records to hundreds of billions of records.  With each order-of-magnitude increase in size new insights emerge.</p> <p>What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sharpness of Transition - the seemingly instantaneous switch from boring to deep insights.  From mundane operational reports to high-impact decision support.</p> </li> <li> <p>Their Unpredictably - the rate of enterprise knowledge graph insights is unpredictable, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable as knowledge graph models scale.  Getting accountants to place a value on future insights is a challenge.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Within the framework of systems thinking and complex adaptive systems, emergence refers to the phenomenon where larger entities, patterns, and behaviors arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities that themselves do not exhibit such properties. This concept is central to understanding how complex systems evolve and adapt over time, often in unpredictable ways. The interactions among the system's components can lead to the emergence of new properties and behaviors that are not inherent in the individual components but are a result of their collective interplay.</p> <p>In the context of building centralized enterprise knowledge graphs, emergence plays a crucial role in shaping strategic thinking for several reasons:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Understanding Complexity and Interconnectivity: Enterprise knowledge graphs aim to represent and store complex information in an interconnected, accessible manner. Recognizing the emergent properties of the system can help in understanding how different pieces of information relate to each other and influence the whole system. This understanding is critical for accurately mapping relationships and dependencies within the knowledge graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adaptability and Evolution: As enterprises evolve, so do their knowledge needs and the structure of their knowledge graphs. Emergent properties highlight the need for these graphs to be adaptable and capable of evolving. This adaptability is essential for incorporating new information, relationships, and patterns that arise as the organization grows and changes. Strategic thinking, in this case, involves planning for flexibility and scalability from the outset.</p> </li> <li> <p>Innovation and Discovery: The concept of emergence encourages a strategic approach that is open to innovation and discovery. As new patterns and insights emerge from the data and relationships encoded in the knowledge graph, organizations can identify unforeseen opportunities or challenges. This can lead to innovative approaches to problem-solving and decision-making, based on insights that were not apparent without the holistic view provided by the knowledge graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decision-making and Strategy: Emergent properties can significantly impact decision-making and strategic planning. By understanding and anticipating how certain inputs or changes might affect the larger system, leaders can make more informed decisions. For instance, recognizing potential emergent behaviors might influence the design of the knowledge graph, such as incorporating mechanisms for real-time updates or feedback loops to capture dynamic changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Risk Management: Identifying and understanding emergent properties can also help in risk management. By analyzing how different elements of the knowledge graph interact, organizations can anticipate potential issues or bottlenecks and develop strategies to mitigate these risks before they escalate.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"intro/ch-05-emergence/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>The bottom line is that systems thinking can be difficult for newcomers.

Resisting Change","text":"<ul> <li>Description: A system resists efforts to change or improve it, often because of entrenched interests, habits, or structural barriers.</li> <li>Example: A company tries to implement a new technology platform to improve efficiency, but employees resist adopting it because they are comfortable with the old system, causing delays and increasing costs in the transition.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"prompts/enumerating-archetypes/#29-fallacy-of-aggregation","title":"29. Fallacy of Aggregation","text":"<ul> <li>Description: This archetype occurs when the performance or behavior of individual parts of a system is mistaken for the performance of the system as a whole.</li> <li>Example: In an organization with multiple departments, each department might be meeting its goals, but the organization as a whole is underperforming because the goals of individual departments are not aligned with the company's overall strategic objectives.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"prompts/enumerating-archetypes/#30-threshold-effects","title":"30. Threshold Effects","text":"<ul> <li>Description: A small change has little or no effect on the system until a critical threshold is reached, after which the system changes drastically.</li> <li>Example: Climate change often operates through threshold effects; for example, warming might have little visible impact on an ecosystem until a tipping point is reached, after which the system may experience rapid and irreversible shifts, such as the collapse of ice sheets or coral reefs.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"prompts/enumerating-archetypes/#31-goal-inversion","title":"31.

The \"Tragedy of the Commons\" refers to a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource.</p> <p>The Tragedy of the Commons is a key Archetype that I use when I teach my systems thinking classes.

The resource should have a limit to how much it can be used sustainably.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create User Profiles: Develop profiles for different users of the resource. These users should have the ability to extract or use the resource at varying rates. For instance, in a fishing lake simulation, each user could decide how many fish to catch per turn.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set Resource Regeneration Rules: Establish rules for how the resource regenerates over time. For a fish population, you could have a growth rate that depends on the remaining population size.</p> </li> <li> <p>Develop a User Interface: Create an interface where students can make decisions for their user profile. Include sliders or input fields where they can decide how much of the resource to use each turn.</p> </li> <li> <p>Implement Feedback Mechanisms: The simulation should provide feedback on the state of the common resource after each round of usage, showing how the resource level changes based on the collective actions of all users.</p> </li> <li> <p>Introduce Scenarios or Challenges: You could introduce external factors that affect the resource, like environmental changes, to add complexity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Incorporate Visualizations: Graphs or other visual aids can help students see the long-term trends of the resource level and the impacts of their decisions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Facilitate Discussion and Debriefing: After the simulation, hold a discussion. Ask students to reflect on how their actions affected the resource and what strategies could have led to more sustainable outcomes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Draw Connections to Real-world Issues: Relate the simulation to real-world examples of the Tragedy of the Commons, like overfishing, deforestation, and pollution. This helps students understand the practical implications of the concept.</p> </li> <li> <p>Highlight the Role of Regulations and Agreements: Discuss how regulations, agreements, or cooperative strategies could prevent the tragedy of the commons. This could lead to a deeper understanding of environmental policies and community management strategies.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Through this interactive experience, students can grasp the challenges of managing shared resources and the importance of sustainable practices and cooperation.</p>"}]}
