Archetypes unify disciplines that have often been taught as separate things \u2013 psychology, economics, biology, urban planning, technology, government systems, etc. \u2013 because they can be universally found in all systems. Archetypes are to systems what Patterns are to software. Balancing Loop A type of cause and effect interactions that counter a change with a push in the opposite direction. Also known as: Negative feedback Causal Loop Diagrams Diagrams that show the dynamic relationship of sub-components of Systems where changes in the state of any component have causal impacts on other components of the system. Denormalized Data Model A data model that has been flattened to use multiple columns to represent different dimensions of the real world. Denormalized data is easier to load into relational databases Denormalized data may be more difficult to query Digital Twin A representation of a real-world item in a virtual world. EKGs are a way to model real-world components that interact with each other. Dynamics The change of component stocks and system interconnections over time. Dynamic Equilibrium The stage in the evolution of a system where the flows between system components reaches a balancing point. Edge of Chaos A transition space between order and disorder that is hypothesized to exist within a wide variety of systems. This transition zone is a region of bounded instability that engenders a constant dynamic interplay between order and disorder. Within the context of EKGs, it is the region that should be modeled to give the highest return on investment. Wikipedia Page on the Edge of chaos Feedback A chain of events that begin when outputs of a component are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. Feedback Delay The time it takes for a stimulus to trigger events that return to impact the original source of the stimulus. Flow The migration of ideas, information or resources from one system component to other system components over time. Graph Database A database of items that is decomposed into vertices and edges, each of which have attributes. There are many types of graph databases that model the state of the world in different ways. What many of them share in common is their ability to traverse relationships between items without Hierarchy A systems diagram where material or information flows up and down a tree-like structure. Influence Diagram A type of causal graph that shows how individuals or groups impact each other's thinking. Knowledge Representation ISO Definition A term definition that conforms to ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry guidelines. Precise: - The definition should have clear meaning and semantics using words with narrow definitions. Concise: - The definition should be as short as possible in length without compromising precision. Good definitions are typically 1 or 2 sentences. Distinct - The definition does not have the same definition as other concepts in a vocabulary. Noncircular - The definition does not use the original term in defining the definition. Unencumbered with Rules - There are no context-specific business rules that would limit the use of the term to a narrow context. Rules can be stated after a definition but should not be part of the ISO definition. The origin of these guidelines for ISO definition comes from work in the ISO/IEC 11179 Metadata Registry standards committee. Leverage Points Places in a system where a small change can lead to a large change in system behavior. Limiting Factor A factor in a system that limits it ability to perform. Relational database JOIN performance has been a key limiting factor in creating precise real-world models within databases. Linear Relationship Nonlinear In the field of systems dynamics, nonlinear refers to the fact that a small change in one component may result is a large changes in related component. Our brains need special training to understand the ways that nonlinear systems interact and to understand the long-term impact of nonlinear dynamics. For example, in ecology a small change in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may cause a large change in global temperature. In commerce, a small change in product quality may lead to poor reviews, lower recommendations and a dramatic drop in sales. Normalized Data Models Data models that faithfully model the complex relationships of the real world. When models capture the real-world accurately, they can be shared among many business units. Highly normalized data models don't scale well on older RDBMS technologies. Resilience The ability of systems to retain stable functionality under changing conditions. Reinforcing Loop An amplifying or enhancing feedback loop, also known as a \u201cpositive feedback loop\u201d because it reinforces the direction of change. These are vicious cycles and virtuous circles. Scale Out The ability of a graph database to grow in capability by adding new computational resources to a database cluster. Self-organization Shifting Dominance The change over time of the relative strengths of competing feedback loops. Stock An accumulation of material or information that has built up in a system or a sub-component over time. A stock may include the memory of the history of changing flows within the system. Suboptimization The behavior resulting from a subsystem\u2019s goals dominating at the expense of the total system\u2019s goals. Sustainability Systems that perform well over time despite changes in their environment. Sustainable systems have resilience despite unexpected changes in either external or internal changes in both structure and flows of information. Systems Dynamics How systems change over time. Systems Dynamics System A cohesive group of interrelated yet interdependent parts which interact over time. Systems are both natural or human-made. Systems Thinking A problem solving method that decomposes complex entities into a set of parts that interact over time. System Theory The interdisciplinary study of systems. Unintended Consequences Outcomes of a purposeful action that are not intended or foreseen. * W","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#glossary-of-terms","text":"","title":"Glossary of Terms"},{"location":"glossary/#archetypes","text":"A small set of system structures that produce common behavioral patterns across many different fields.

Eight orders of magnitude. A ten-million fold increase in performance. Response times that are one ten-millionth of the time they used to be. This is what is happing to our enterprise information systems as we move from legacy relational databases to scalable knowledge graphs. We can break it down into three parts: Native graph databases allow for 1,000 fold better relationship traversal than RDBMS JOINs on million-row tables. That is our first three orders of magnitude change. Querys run 1,000x.

Eight orders of magnitude. A ten-million fold increase in performance. Response times that are one ten-millionth of the time they used to be. This is what is happing to our enterprise information systems as we move from legacy relational databases to scalable knowledge graphs. We can break it down into three parts: Native graph databases allow for 1,000 fold better relationship traversal than RDBMS JOINs on million-row tables.

Over time, the agent\u2019s will is eroded and cannot function without the intervenor. (examples: government subsidies, worshipping \u201cgurus\u201d, free health insurance). Eroding Goals \u2013 where an agent\u2019s failure to reach its goals causes it to set lower and lower goals over time. (examples: politicians revising their original \u201cpromises\u201d, failed exercise goals). Escalation \u2013 where competing agents one-up each other causing a snowball effect in behavior. Sometimes the desire to beat competitors distracts each agent from pursuing its own unique vision. (examples: competitive price wars, feuds, terrorism). Limits to Growth \u2013 where a once successfully growing system hits a resource limit that constrains its future growth. (examples: market saturation, populations reaching carrying capacities) Policy Resistance \u2013 where the actors of a system find ways to work around rules or regulations imposed on them in order to achieve their goals. (examples: black markets, tax loopholes) Seeking the Wrong Goal \u2013 where an agent pursues a goal that is not aligned with its vision. This wrong goal might be self-selected or incentivized by an authority. (examples: incentives that reward quantity and ignoring quality, confusing number of degrees held for intelligence, pursuing monetary wealth at the expense of all else). 1. Exponential Success \u2013 where success today leads to further success in the future. (examples: rich get richer, network effects) Tragedy of the Commons \u2013 where multiple agents, behaving in their self interest, escalate actions that deplete a shared resource and over time leads to the resource\u2019s extinction.
