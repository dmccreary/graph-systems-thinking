Wikipedia Page on the Edge of chaos Feedback Graph Databases Knowledge Representation ISO Definition A term definition that conforms to ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry guidelines. Precise: - The definition should have clear meaning and semantics using words with narrow definitions. Concise: - The definition should be as short as possible in length without compromising precision. Good definitions are typically 1 or 2 sentences. Distinct - The definition does not have the same definition as other concepts in a vocabulary. Noncircular - The definition does not use the original term in defining the definition. Unencumbered with Rules - There are no context-specific business rules that would limit the use of the term to a narrow context. Rules can be stated after a definition but should not be part of the ISO definition. The origin of these guidelines for ISO definition comes from work in the ISO/IEC 11179 Metadata Registry standards committee.
