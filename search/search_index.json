Network Effect Tragedy of the Commons A situation in economic science when individual users, who have open access to a resource unhampered by shared social structures or formal rules that govern access and use, act independently according to their own self-interest and, contrary to the common good of all users, cause depletion of the resource through their uncoordinated actions. The term is derived from an 1833 story by the English economist William Forster Lloyd in which cattle herders share a common parcel of land. They originally used a social convention where the cows graze. This was the custom in English villages at the time.

The AI Flywheel is a central tool that allows large companies with large amounts of data to use this data to get even more data. This makes it difficult for new-entrants. Archetype An ideal example of something. In the field of Graph Systems Thinking we use the term archetype to describe a small and simple example that teaches one of the key concepts in Graph Systems Thinking. A small set of system structures that produce common behavioral patterns across many different fields. Archetypes unify disciplines that have often been taught as separate things \u2013 psychology, economics, biology, urban planning, technology, government systems, etc. \u2013 because they can be universally found in all systems. Archetypes are to systems what Patterns are to software. See Also: Tragedy of The Commons Seel Also: The AI Flywheel Balancing Loop A type of cause and effect interactions that counter a change with a push in the opposite direction. Also known as: Negative feedback Canonical Schema A standardized official approved way to represent data on-the-wire as it moves between computer systems. The process of converting non-standardized representations of data is to perform Schema Matching and Schema Mapping . Causal Loop Diagrams Diagrams that show the dynamic relationship of sub-components of Systems where changes in the state of any component have causal impacts on other components of the system. Denormalized Data Model A data model that has been flattened to use multiple columns to represent different dimensions of the real world. Denormalized data is easier to load into relational databases Denormalized data may be more difficult to query Digital Twin A representation of a real-world item in a virtual world. EKGs are a way to model real-world components that interact with each other. Dynamics The change of component stocks and system interconnections over time. Dynamic Equilibrium The stage in the evolution of a system where the flows between system components reaches a balancing point. Edge of Chaos A transition space between order and disorder that is hypothesized to exist within a wide variety of systems. This transition zone is a region of bounded instability that engenders a constant dynamic interplay between order and disorder. Within the context of EKGs, it is the region that should be modeled to give the highest return on investment. Wikipedia Page on the Edge of chaos Feedback A chain of events that begin when outputs of a component are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. Feedback Delay The time it takes for a stimulus to trigger events that return to impact the original source of the stimulus. Flow The migration of ideas, information or resources from one system component to other system components over time. Graph Database A database of items that is decomposed into vertices and edges, each of which have attributes. There are many types of graph databases that model the state of the world in different ways. What many of them share in common is their ability to traverse relationships between items without using query time JOIN comparisons of primary and foreign keys. JOIN operations became one of the principal reasons that graph databases provide 1,000x performance over relational databases. Graph Systems Thinking A multidisciplinary field of study that uses systems thinking to understand the business value of connected data. Also known as: GST Hierarchy A systems diagram where material or information flows up and down a tree-like structure. Influence Diagram A type of causal graph that shows how individuals or groups impact each other's thinking. Knowledge Representation ISO Definition A term definition that conforms to ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry guidelines. Precise: - The definition should have clear meaning and semantics using words with narrow definitions. Concise: - The definition should be as short as possible in length without compromising precision. Good definitions are typically 1 or 2 sentences. Distinct - The definition does not have the same definition as other concepts in a vocabulary. Noncircular - The definition does not use the original term in defining the definition. Unencumbered with Rules - There are no context-specific business rules that would limit the use of the term to a narrow context. Rules can be stated after a definition but should not be part of the ISO definition. The origin of these guidelines for ISO definition comes from work in the ISO/IEC 11179 Metadata Registry standards committee. Leverage Points Places in a system where a small change can lead to a large change in system behavior. Limiting Factor A factor in a system that limits it ability to perform. Relational database JOIN performance has been a key limiting factor in creating precise real-world models within databases. Linear Relationship Nonlinear In the field of systems dynamics, nonlinear refers to the fact that a small change in one component may result is a large changes in related component. Our brains need special training to understand the ways that nonlinear systems interact and to understand the long-term impact of nonlinear dynamics. For example, in ecology a small change in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may cause a large change in global temperature. In commerce, a small change in product quality may lead to poor reviews, lower recommendations and a dramatic drop in sales. Normalized Data Models Data models that faithfully model the complex relationships of the real world. When models capture the real-world accurately, they can be shared among many business units. Highly normalized data models don't scale well on older RDBMS technologies. Resilience The ability of systems to retain stable functionality under changing conditions. Reinforcing Loop An amplifying or enhancing feedback loop, also known as a \u201cpositive feedback loop\u201d because it reinforces the direction of change. These are vicious cycles and virtuous circles. Scale Out The ability of a graph database to grow in capability by adding new computational resources to a database cluster. Self-organization Shifting Dominance The change over time of the relative strengths of competing feedback loops. Stock An accumulation of material or information that has built up in a system or a sub-component over time. A stock may include the memory of the history of changing flows within the system. Suboptimization The behavior resulting from a subsystem\u2019s goals dominating at the expense of the total system\u2019s goals. Sustainability Systems that perform well over time despite changes in their environment. Sustainable systems have resilience despite unexpected changes in either external or internal changes in both structure and flows of information. Systems Dynamics How systems change over time. Systems Dynamics System A cohesive group of interrelated yet interdependent parts which interact over time. Systems are both natural or human-made. Systems Thinking A problem solving method that decomposes complex entities into a set of parts that interact over time. System Theory The interdisciplinary study of systems.

From Thinking in Systems by Donella H.

The book uses a unique four-part decomposition analysis rule model called DSRP: Distinction Rule - how to distinguish things in systems Systems Rule - how to separate or join items in systems Relationship Rule - how to find relationships between items in a system Perspectives Rule - how to see different points-of-view when analyzing systems I think the decomposition approach is sound but I have not used it extensively. My only disappointment is that they only spend a few pages on Causal Loop Diagrams. Thinking in Systems Thinking in Systems by Donella H. Meadows. This is one of the key books by Systems Thinking pioneer Donnela Meadows. The text is well written and she has good examples. Systems Thinking for Social Change Systems Thinking for Social Change by David Peter Stroh, 2015 by Chelsea Green Publishing I got this book specifically for my volunteer work doing STEM curriculum development for my volunteer work. It has many good examples for the application of Systems Thinking to promote social responsibility. The bylines on the book are: A Practical Guide to Solving Complex Problems Avoiding Unintended Consequences and Achieving Lasting Results The Fifth Discipline The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of Learning Organization by Peter M. Senge This is one of the original books that took a formal approach to applying Systems Thinking to the problems of businesses. It was written in 1990 before \"Systems Thinking\" was popular. Although Senge covers many topics in this book and does not call the concepts \"Systems Thinking\" - he clearly gets the fact that the structure of systems influences their behavior. He also has many examples of causal loop diagrams but he calls them \"Systems Diagrams\". I would not use this book as my first book on Systems Thinking. I think of it more as a historical reference written by the person that made Systems Thinking popular in business. Introduction to the Theory of Complex Systems Introduction to the Theory of Complex Systems by Stefan Thurner, Rudolf Hanel and Peter Klimek. Published in 2018 by Oxford University Press. This book was given to me by my Systems Thinking mentor, Arun Batchu in December of 2019. It is designed as a two-semester graduate-level textbook for students that have had two+ years of Calculus. Although I don't understand all the math, this book shows that Systems Thinking is a entry ramp in the the world of complex adaptive systems where we can create simulations of the world and test our hypothesis of how structural changes can impact behavior. There are two topics in this book that I don't see covered in other books. Scale Laws - how as systems grow is size, the behavior changes Evolutionary Processes - how systems continually adapt to fit their changing environments The Systems Thinker Series Six book series by Albert Ruthorford Book 1: The Systems Thinker: Essential Thinking Skills For Solving Problems, Managing Chaos, and Creating Lasting Solutions in a Complex World Book 2: The Systems Thinker - Analytical Skills: Level Up Your Decision Making, Problem Solving, and Deduction Skills.

Through exercises and simulation models participants experience the long-term side effects and impacts of decisions and understand the ways in which performance is tied to structures and policies. Systems thinking was devised to improve people's ability to manage organizations comprehensively in a volatile global environment. It offers managers a framework for understanding complex situations and the dynamics those situations produce. Systems thinking\u009d is a response to the rapid changes in technology, population, and economic activity that are transforming the world, and as a way to deal with the ever-increasing complexity of today's business. Senior managers can use the system dynamics method to design policies that lead their organizations to high performance. The program is intended to give participants the tools and confidence to manage organizations with full understanding and solid strategy. Participants will experience the Beer Game , a table game, developed by Jay Forrester. Played with pen, paper, printed plastic tablecloths, and poker chips, it simulates the supply chain of the beer industry. In so doing, it illuminates aspects of system dynamics, a signature mode of MIT thought: it illustrates the nonlinear complexities of supply chains and the way individuals are circumscribed by the systems in which they act. You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course. You may also be interested in our Executive Certificates which are designed around a central themed track and consist of several courses. Learn more.

Senge This is one of the original books that took a formal approach to applying Systems Thinking to the problems of businesses. It was written in 1990 before \"Systems Thinking\" was popular. Although Senge covers many topics in this book and does not call the concepts \"Systems Thinking\" - he clearly gets the fact that the structure of systems influences their behavior. He also has many examples of causal loop diagrams but he calls them \"Systems Diagrams\". I would not use this book as my first book on Systems Thinking.

Although I don't understand all the math, this book shows that Systems Thinking is a entry ramp in the the world of complex adaptive systems where we can create simulations of the world and test our hypothesis of how structural changes can impact behavior. There are two topics in this book that I don't see covered in other books.

Through exercises and simulation models participants experience the long-term side effects and impacts of decisions and understand the ways in which performance is tied to structures and policies. Systems thinking was devised to improve people's ability to manage organizations comprehensively in a volatile global environment. It offers managers a framework for understanding complex situations and the dynamics those situations produce. Systems thinking\u009d is a response to the rapid changes in technology, population, and economic activity that are transforming the world, and as a way to deal with the ever-increasing complexity of today's business. Senior managers can use the system dynamics method to design policies that lead their organizations to high performance. The program is intended to give participants the tools and confidence to manage organizations with full understanding and solid strategy. Participants will experience the Beer Game , a table game, developed by Jay Forrester. Played with pen, paper, printed plastic tablecloths, and poker chips, it simulates the supply chain of the beer industry. In so doing, it illuminates aspects of system dynamics, a signature mode of MIT thought: it illustrates the nonlinear complexities of supply chains and the way individuals are circumscribed by the systems in which they act. You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

That is what the new enterprise knowledge graph (EKG) industry is creating for organizations. The hypothesis of this book is that the old ways of problem solving with relational databases will not work at the scale of EKGs. We need new ways to think. Systems Thinking is the foundation of this new generation of problem solving tools. Audience This book in intended for the following audience: People that are trying to use Systems Thinking as a tool to promote Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) People trying to understand the potential strategic impact of EKGs on large organizations. People that are attempting to debug the common glitches in adoption of EKGs as a central strategic platform for organizational sustainability. Looking at the constraints of the past and realizing they are not the same constraints of the future. There is no programming or math background required for this book, although familiarity with drawing tools and online shared waterboarding tools is encouraged. Our Values We value storytelling and the use of metaphors to help us communicate with non-technical staff. Book Structure The book is broken down into three parts. Part 1: Introduction Chapter 1: Introduction - what was once too expensive is now affordable Chapter 2: Graphs - Where are enterprise knowledge graphs as why are they central to future organizational strategy Chapter 3: Systems Thinking - What is Systems Thinking? Why is a good tool for EKG analysis? Chapter 4: Graph and Systems Thinking - Applying Systems Thinking to Graph Adoption Part 2: Case Studies These will be detailed stories of how teams have used systems thinking to promote graph adoption.

Archetypes The Eight Systems Archetypes: Addiction \u2013 where an agent becomes dependent on an external intervenor, or a crutch. Over time, the agent\u2019s will is eroded and cannot function without the intervenor. (examples: government subsidies, worshipping \u201cgurus\u201d, free health insurance). Eroding Goals \u2013 where an agent\u2019s failure to reach its goals causes it to set lower and lower goals over time. (examples: politicians revising their original \u201cpromises\u201d, failed exercise goals). Escalation \u2013 where competing agents one-up each other causing a snowball effect in behavior. Sometimes the desire to beat competitors distracts each agent from pursuing its own unique vision. (examples: competitive price wars, feuds, terrorism). Limits to Growth \u2013 where a once successfully growing system hits a resource limit that constrains its future growth. (examples: market saturation, populations reaching carrying capacities) Policy Resistance \u2013 where the actors of a system find ways to work around rules or regulations imposed on them in order to achieve their goals. (examples: black markets, tax loopholes) Seeking the Wrong Goal \u2013 where an agent pursues a goal that is not aligned with its vision. This wrong goal might be self-selected or incentivized by an authority. (examples: incentives that reward quantity and ignoring quality, confusing number of degrees held for intelligence, pursuing monetary wealth at the expense of all else). 1. Exponential Success \u2013 where success today leads to further success in the future. (examples: rich get richer, network effects) Tragedy of the Commons \u2013 where multiple agents, behaving in their self interest, escalate actions that deplete a shared resource and over time leads to the resource\u2019s extinction.
