# About this book

## Audience

This book in intended for...

People trying to understand the impact of graph databases on large organizations.

Looking at the constraints of the past and realizing they are not the same constraints of the future.

There is no programming or math background required for this book.

## Our Values

We value storytelling and the use of metaphors to help us communicate with non-technical staff.

#### Edge of Chaos
A transition space between order and disorder that is hypothesized to exist within a wide variety of systems. This transition zone is a region of bounded instability that engenders a constant dynamic interplay between order and disorder.

Within the context of EKGs, it is the region that should be modeled to give the highest return on investment.

#### Feedback

#### Graph Databases

#### Knowledge Representation

#### ISO Definition
A term definition that conforms to ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry guidelines.

* **Precise:** - The definition should have clear meaning and semantics using words with narrow definitions.
* **Concise:** - The definition should be as short as possible in length without compromising precision.  Good definitions are typically 1 or 2 sentences.
* **Distinct** - The definition does not have the same definition as other concepts in a vocabulary.
* **Noncircular** - The definition does not use the original term in defining the definition.
* **Unencumbered with Rules** - There are no context-specific business rules that would limit the use of the term to a narrow context.  Rules can be stated after a definition but should not be part of the ISO definition.

The origin of these guidelines for ISO definition comes from work in the ISO/IEC 11179 Metadata Registry standards committee.
