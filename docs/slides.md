## 2021 Knowledge Graph Conference

This was the first 1/2 day workshop I did on systems thinking.
The slides are here:

[Graph Systems Thinking 2021 Version](https://github.com/dmccreary/graph-systems-thinking/raw/main/slides/GST-Half-Day-Workshop-2021.pptx) - this was presented to the Knowledge Graph conference in 2021.
The slides don't really capture the workshop activities for the participants.

## Optum Architecture Conference

In the summer of 2022, I was asked to speak at the Optum Architecture conference.  Their theme was "Borderless Codevelopment" which
placed a focus on breaking down the silos within UHG.

Note I had to remove some material from this slide deck that was confidential to UHG/Optum.
