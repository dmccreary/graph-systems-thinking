#### Edge of Chaos
A transition space between order and disorder that is hypothesized to exist within a wide variety of systems. This transition zone is a region of bounded instability that engenders a constant dynamic interplay between order and disorder.

Within the context of EKGs, it is the region that should be modeled to give the highest return on investment.

### ISO Definition
A term definition that conforms to ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry guidelines.

* **Precise:** - The definition should have clear meaning and semantics using words with narrow definitions.
* **Concise:** - The definition should be as short as possible in length without compromising precision.  Good definitions are typically 1 or 2 sentences.
* **Distinct** - The definition does not have the same definition as other concepts in a vocabulary.
* **Noncircular** - The definition does not use the original term in defining the definition.
* **Unencumbered with Rules** - There are no context-specific business rules that would limit the use of the term to a narrow context.  Rules can be stated after a definition but should not be part of the ISO definition.

The origin of these guidelines for ISO definition comes from work in the ISO/IEC 11179 Metadata Registry standards committee.
