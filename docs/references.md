## Books on Systems Thinking

#### Systems Thinking Made Simple

[Systems Thinking Made Simple: A new Hope for Solving Wicked Problems](https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Thinking-Made-Simple-Problems/dp/1948486024) is a well written wonderfully illustrated book on Systems Thinking, but it also includes many other related topics like Mind Mapping, Scaling and a light overview of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). 

 The book uses a unique four-part decomposition analysis rule model called DSRP:

1. **Distinction Rule** - how to distinguish things in systems
2. **Systems Rule** - how to separate or join items in systems
3. **Relationship Rule** - how to find relationships between items in a system
4. **Perspectives Rule** - how to see different points-of-view when analyzing systems

I think the decomposition approach is sound but I have not used it extensively.

My only dissapointment is that they only spend a few pages on Causal Loop Diagrams.

#### Thinking in Systems
[Thinking in Systems](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems/) by Donella H. Meadows.

This is one of the key books by Systems Thinking pioneer Donnela Meadows.  The text is well written and she has good examples. 

#### Systems Thinking for Social Change
[Systems Thinking for Social Change](https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Thinking-Social-Change-Consequences/dp/160358580X/ref=asc_df_160358580X) by David Peter Stroh, 2015 by Chelsea Green Publishing

I got this book specifically for my volunteer work doing STEM curriculum development for my volunteer work.  It has many good examples for the application of Systems Thinking to promote social responsibility.

The bylines on the book are:

1. A Practical Guide to Solving Complex Problems
2. Avoiding Unintended Consequences and
3. Achieving Lasting Results

#### The Fifth Discipline

[The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of Learning Organization](https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Learning-Organization/dp/0385517254/ref=sr_1_1) by Peter M. Senge

This is one of the original books that took a formal approach to applying Systems Thinking to the problems of businesses.  It was written in 1990 before "Systems Thinking" was popular.  Although Senge covers many topics in this book and does not call the concepts "Systems Thinking" - he clearly gets the fact that the structure of systems influences their behavior.  He also has many examples of causal loop diagrams but he calls them "Systems Diagrams".

I would not use this book as my first book on Systems Thinking.  I think of it more as a historical reference written by the person that made Systems Thinking popular in business.
