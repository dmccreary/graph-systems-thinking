## About this MicroSim

This MicroSim teaches us the story of the Tragedy of
the Commons.  As you add more cows to the pasture, the
grass gets over-grazed.

## Sample Prompt

```linenums="0"
Create a simulation of the Tragedy of the Commons.
```

## Refinements

1. Make the cows go towards the most grass
2. Make the grass permanently die if it reaches a level of 0
3. Make the cows die if they don't eat enough grass
