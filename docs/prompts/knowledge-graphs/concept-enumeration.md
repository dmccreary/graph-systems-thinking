# Prompt for Concept Enumeration

## Prompt

```linenums="0"
I am teaching a course on Systems Thinking.
This is a 10-week hands-on course that allows
students to develop strong Systems Thinking skills.
I would like to understand the key
concepts that need to be presented in this course and
the order in which they should be taught.

Please create a list of the 200 essential concepts
names in a Systems Thinking course. For each concept,
just return the concept name.
Make sure that the concepts are distinct and not duplicates.

Start the list with the most basic foundational concepts and then
proceed to the most complex concepts. Return
a single numbered markdown list with one line per concept.
Feel free to short names
and abbreviations so the list can be used to draw
a concept network graph.
```
