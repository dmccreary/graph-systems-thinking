# Systems Thinking Quotes

#### Russell Ackoff in 1979
Managers are not confronted with problems that are independent of each other, but with dynamic situations that consist of complex systems of changing problems that interact with each other. I call such situations messes. Problems are abstractions extracted from messes by analysis…. Managers do not solve problems; they manage messes

#### Robert Pirsig
If a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is left standing, then that rationality will simply produce another factory. If a revolution destroys a government, but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves. . . . There’s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding.

—Robert Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

#### Systems and Us

Systems are everywhere and they impact every aspect of our wellbeing. You are part of many systems and systems within systems – the company you work for, the industry you work in, the national economy, the global economy. You’ve participated in the education system and healthcare system of your country. And if you live in a democracy, you have the opportunity to vote for candidates to assume government positions and vote for or against local laws  that you most likely have limited and biased information about.

#### Feedback
Simple causal reasoning about a feedback system is difficult because the first system influences the second and second system influences the first, leading to a circular argument. This makes reasoning based upon cause and effect tricky, and it is necessary to analyze the system as a whole.
