This video of Dr. Otto Scharmer from MIT explores how **systems thinking** can help close the gap between what we know and what we doâ€”especially at the collective level where implementation of known solutions often fails. 

### ðŸŽ¯ Summary of the Video Transcript: *Systems Thinking and Awareness-Based Change*

This video explores how **systems thinking** can help close the gap between what we know and what we doâ€”especially at the collective level where implementation of known solutions often fails. The speaker uses the **Iceberg Model** to illustrate that visible problems are rooted in deeper, often unseen layers such as structures, mental models (paradigms), and our inner sources of consciousness.

### Key Concepts:

1. **The Knowingâ€“Doing Gap**:
   Although individuals are becoming more aware and responsive to major societal and environmental problems, **collective action still lags** behind. Systems thinking is essential to bridge this gap by addressing deeper causes.

2. **The Iceberg Model**:
   Real change requires addressing what lies **below the surface**â€”not just behaviors (the tip of the iceberg), but also the underlying structures, thought paradigms, and personal/internal sources that shape them.

3. **The Three Divides**:

   * **Ecological divide**: Our disconnect from nature.
   * **Social divide**: Polarization and inequality between people.
   * **Spiritual divide**: The disconnection between oneâ€™s current self and future potential.

4. **Four Principles of Awareness-Based Systems Change**:

   * *You canâ€™t understand a system until you try to change it* (action learning).
   * *You canâ€™t change a system without transforming consciousness* (the mindset of people running the system matters more than structures).
   * *You canâ€™t transform consciousness without making the system see, sense, and invert itself*:

     * **See**: Visualize and understand the system.
     * **Sense**: Emotionally empathize with all stakeholders, especially marginalized voices.
     * **Invert**: Realize that external transformation starts with **internal transformation**.
   * *You canâ€™t lead transformation unless you sense and presence the future as it emerges*:
     This involves stepping into the unknown and nurturing deep human capacitiesâ€”**not just reasoning, but sensing and feeling future possibilities**.

5. **The Role of Leadership**:
   True leadership means stepping forward into uncharted territory and **presencing** (bringing into being) an emerging future by tapping into deeper human faculties like **intuition, empathy, and imagination**.

6. **Limits of AI**:
   While AI excels at learning from the past, it lacks the human ability to deeply **sense** and creatively **lean into the future**. Cultivating this human potential is critical in the age of AI.

This talk is a call to **deep personal and collective transformation** using systems thinking not just as a diagnostic tool, but as a **path to change through awareness and inner development**.
