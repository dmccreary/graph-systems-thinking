#### Course Touched Multiple Pain Points

Thank you for very interesting session about graph system thinking and insightful Q&A. I hope to follow your journey. You have touched multiple pain points I currently have: PKGs, hardware support, graph system thinking... so, it is very good you have put so much effort into your blog. I am plan to study it once I am done with KGC.

#### Expanded Possibilities of EKGs
I really enjoyed your graph systems thinking course.  It really expanded my thoughts about the possible opportunities as I start advocating for the development of an EKGs.  Thanks again for the course and the various pointers to additional information.

#### EKGs and the Quality Movement

I really enjoyed your course on graph systems thinking and your Medium articles.
I point people to them as references.  

Your conversation about bringing on influencers is very reminiscent of the experience we had around the quality movement.  The folks you have to convince to commit resources really do not understand the technology and speak only the languages of money and power.  You have to approach them from where they are.  Technical arguments do not work.  Mostly you have to show them how they can get more money and power (or reduce the risk of losing) by supporting your program.

#### Enjoyed Course
Really enjoyed your course on graph and systems thinkings. I'd love to get connected and discuss the future of KGs. We at OriginTrail are working on a decentralized knowledge graph, enabled by trusted data sharing utilizing blockchain for mediation. Looking forward to the rest of the workshop!
