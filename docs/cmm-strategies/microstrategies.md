# MicroStrategies for Promoting Systems Thinking

## Sample Prompt
I work at a medium-sized company (10,000 employees) 
that is at Capability Maturing Model (CMM) level 2
(Repeatable) concerning our use of Systems Thinking. 
We have a few staff members who are interested in
systems thinking, but we would like to move to the
next level of maturity (Defined).

Our focus now is to have clearly defined and
documented processes for getting our managers
to break down silos using systems thinking
and stop having managers only focus on the
short-term profitability of their own business
unit.

The Defined Level in CMM is characteristic of processes 
that create sets of defined and documented standard
peer-reviewed processes established and subject to some
degree of improvement over time. These standard processes
are in place. The processes may not have been systematically
or repeatedly used - sufficient for the users to become
competent or the process to be validated in a range of
situations. This could be considered a developmental
stage - with use in a wider range of conditions and
user competence development the process can develop to
the next level of maturity.

A microstrategy is a small step that we can do to move 
forward in a strategic direction. It can often be a 
simple survey, a contest, a seminar, a presentation, 
a laptop sticker, an award or recognition or a prize.

Please list 20 microstrategies we can use to move
from system thinking level 2 (repeatable) to
system thinking level 3 (defined).
