# Microstrategies for Silo Busting

In 2022 I was asked to give presentations on practical ways
that a company could break down siloed behavior.  Here
are some of the microstrategies that I created:

1. Call out siloed behavior and suggest a solution based on Systems Thinking
1. Think deeply about how our decisions impact our customer/member experiences
Remember that the more connected data we have, the better our ML models will be and the better our recommendations
1. Read a book on Systems Thinking (see me for suggestions)
1. Learn how to draw Causal Loop Diagram (I have PPT and Miro templates), Google “Causal Loop Diagrams”
1. Make your GitHub repo PUBLIC. - Use Hashicorp Vault to store secrets
1. Make your code searchable on HCP with Microsites
1. Create a useful README so that other teams can quickly use your code and tag reusable assets
1. Write a good “Getting Started” guide to encourage others to reuse your code
1. Reward reuse and discourage reinvention
1. Search GitHub and HCP before you create something new (look left, look right, go forward)
1. Consider Open Source before you create new code
1. When you see multiple groups building the same tools, build collaborations
1. Build systems that scale for future users
1. Promote data sharing so data scientists can build better predictive models
1. Encourage high-quality publishing of data dictionaries (semantics and metadata)
1. Promote data standards and data stewardship
1. Look for ways to build bridges between teams building duplicative services
1. Take a course on Systems Thinking
1. Join a discussion group on Systems Thinking
